  # Hey there!

  **I'm a passionate software developer from India and a Master’s in Computer Science.
  I've worked with a bunch of tech stacks, tackled complex projects, and love making systems faster and more efficient. I’ve migrated legacy apps, implemented microservices, and worked closely with teams to get things done. Outside of work, I’m into Aikido, swimming, and organizing fun activities with friends. Let's build something cool together!
