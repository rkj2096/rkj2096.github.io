An application to find number of self-citations. Used Google Scholar for data.

Self-Citation A self-citation is a reference an author provide in a document to other documents written by himself. Self- references may result from the cumulative nature of individual research, the need for personal gratification, or the value of self-citation as a rhetorical and tactical tool in the struggle for visibility and scientific authority
