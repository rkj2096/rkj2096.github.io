It is an implementation of Information Dispersal Algorithm.

In short Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) breaks a file F of length `L = |F|` into n pieces `Fi` , `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, each of length `|Fi| = L/m`, `n > m` so that every m pieces suffice for reconstructing F. It has vast area application, can be used to provide data redundacy protection against unauthorized access.
